    "description": "The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) was established in 1997. UNODCs work is guided by several international treaties and conventions and a series of United Nations norms and rules in crime prevention and criminal justice. UNODC's mission is to build a safer, more peaceful and fairer world by placing the human being at the core of its actions. Consequently, the Office aims to strengthen crime prevention, promote stable criminal justice systems, and combat the threats posed by organized crime, corruption, terrorism and llicit drugs. UNODC's actions must always follow two cross-cutting principles: human rights protection and gender equality."
